# 3DRendererApp
Simple 3D renderer, without any 3D APIs. It is a part of an university project. The idea was to write a 3D renderer without any low level libraries to understand the rendering process. This program draws a Suzanne (monkey model) in 4 modes:
* points
* wireframe
* solid color
* textured model

In addition it is possible to change camera field of view and camera position.
